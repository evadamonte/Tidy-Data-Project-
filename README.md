# 🧹 Tidy Data Project - Olympics 2008 Medalists

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **tidy data principles** to clean, reshape, and analyze a dataset of 2008 Olympic medalists. 

### What is Tidy Data?
According to **Hadley Wickham’s Tidy Data principles**:
- Each variable is stored in its own column.
- Each observation forms its own row.
- Each type of observational unit forms its own table.

By following these principles, we ensure the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis or visualization.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
**Source:** 2008 Olympics Medalists Dataset (provided in CSV format)  
**File:** `olympics_08_medalists.csv`  

### Preprocessing and Cleaning Steps:
- Reshaped from wide to long format using `melt()`
- Separated combined columns using `str.split()`
- Cleaned strings and removed missing values
- Exported cleaned dataset as `tidy_olympics_2008.csv`

## 📊 Visualizations Created
- 📈 Bar chart: Top 10 sports by medal count
- 📈 Bar chart: Medal counts by gender
- 📈 Heatmap: Medal counts by gender and sport
- 📈 Medal type distribution chart colored by **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze**

✅ **Visual Examples:**
