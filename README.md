# TidyData Project - Olympics 2008 Medalists

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project focuses on applying **tidy data principles** to clean and transform an Olympic 2008 Medalists dataset. The goal is to reshape the data for analysis and visualization while following best practices for clean, reproducible data science workflows.

## ðŸ§¹ Tidy Data Principles Applied
- Each variable will be stored in its own column.
- Each observation will form its own row.
- Each type of observational unit will form a table.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Source: 2008 Olympics Medalists dataset (Provided)
- Format: CSV file
- Contains athlete names, events, gender categories, and medal types.

## âœ… Project Goals
- Clean and tidy the dataset
- Create meaningful visualizations
- Provide detailed documentation and rationale for every step
- Practice good coding and GitHub practices
