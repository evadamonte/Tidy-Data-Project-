# ðŸ§¹ Tidy Data Project - Olympics 2008 Medalists

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **tidy data principles** to clean, reshape, and analyze a dataset of 2008 Olympic medalists. 

### What is Tidy Data?
According to **Hadley Wickhamâ€™s Tidy Data principles**:
- Each variable is stored in its own column.
- Each observation forms its own row.
- Each type of observational unit forms its own table.

By following these principles, we ensure the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis or visualization.
