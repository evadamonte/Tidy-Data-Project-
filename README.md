# ðŸ§¹ Tidy Data Project - Olympics 2008 Medalists

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **tidy data principles** to clean, reshape, and analyze a dataset of 2008 Olympic medalists. 

### What is Tidy Data?
According to **Hadley Wickhamâ€™s Tidy Data principles**:
- Each variable is stored in its own column.
- Each observation forms its own row.
- Each type of observational unit forms its own table.

By following these principles, we ensure the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis or visualization.

## ðŸ“¥ Instructions to Run the Notebook
### Requirements:
Install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (if running locally)

### Running the Project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tidy-Data-Project-.git
cd Tidy-Data-Project-
jupyter notebook tidy_data_project.ipynb
```
If using Google Colab, upload the notebook and dataset, then run all cells.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description
**Source:** 2008 Olympics Medalists Dataset (provided in CSV format)  
**File:** `olympics_08_medalists.csv`  

### Preprocessing and Cleaning Steps:
- Reshaped from wide to long format using `melt()`
- Separated combined columns using `str.split()`
- Cleaned strings and removed missing values
- Exported cleaned dataset as `tidy_olympics_2008.csv`

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created
- ðŸ“ˆ Bar chart: Top 10 sports by medal count
- ðŸ“ˆ Bar chart: Medal counts by gender
- ðŸ“ˆ Heatmap: Medal counts by gender and sport
- ðŸ“ˆ Medal type distribution chart colored by **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze**

âœ… **Visual Examples:**
(*Optional â€” add screenshots of your plots here if required by the assignment.*)
